# Weekly schedule

**Terminology**:
*Reading* below means reading and **digesting** (which typically includes a lot of thinking and processing).
After properly reading something, you should be comfortable with the material and be able to explain it to someone else.
The exercises are there to help you and us figure out whether you have reached that level.

## Course week 1 (October 30 – November 3)

Tasks before the weekly meeting:

* Read introduction (including "about this book").
* Read Sections 1–2 and do all the exercises.
* Read Section 3 and choose and solve 3 of the 6 exercises.

Let us know on Zulip if the workload is too low or high.
If you cannot manage timewise, leave Section 3 for later.

Meeting: **November 3, 15:15–17:00** in **EF** (lecture hall on 6th floor of EDIT building)

## Course week 2 (November 6 – November 10)

Tasks before the weekly meeting:

* Read Sections 4–6 and do all the exercises.
  If you feel there are too many exercises, focus on the following:
  - Section 4: 4.2, 4.3, perhaps 4.1
  - Section 5: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, perhaps 5.6 (if you did 4.1)
  - Section 6: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3

* Write on Zulip if you have trouble with anything.
  You can also arrange meetings with teachers in person.

Meeting: **November 10, 15:15–17:00** in **EF**
