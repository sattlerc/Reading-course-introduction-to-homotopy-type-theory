# Weekly schedule

**Terminology**:
*Reading* below means reading and **digesting** (which typically includes a lot of thinking and processing).
After properly reading something, you should be comfortable with the material and be able to explain it to someone else.
The exercises are there to help you and us figure out whether you have reached that level.

## Course week 1 (October 30 – November 3)

Tasks before the weekly meeting:

* Read introduction (including "about this book").
* Read Sections 1–2 and do all the exercises.
* Read Section 3 and choose and solve 3 of the 6 exercises.

Let us know on Zulip if the workload is too low or high.
If you cannot manage timewise, leave Section 3 for later.

Meeting: **November 3, 15:15–17:00** in **EF** (lecture hall on 6th floor of EDIT building)

## Course week 2 (November 6 – November 10)

Tasks before the weekly meeting:

* Read Sections 4–6 and do all the exercises.
  If you feel there are too many exercises, focus on the following:
  - Section 4: 4.2, 4.3, perhaps 4.1
  - Section 5: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, perhaps 5.6 (if you did 4.1)
  - Section 6: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3

  Now that we discussed the formal rules of type theory in the first session, we can do constructions in type theory informally, using natural language (like Egbert does).
  That is, we do not need to present everything in terms of deduction trees.
  This should make the exercises less tedious.
  (The understanding is that you can elaborate informal reasoning to formal deductions using the rules of type theory when someone asks you.)

* Write on Zulip if you have trouble with anything.
  You can also arrange meetings with teachers in person.

Meeting: **November 10, 15:15–17:00** in **EF**

## Course week 3 (November 13 – November 17)

Tasks before the weekly meeting:

* Read the introduction to Chapter II and Sections 9–11.
  Do at least the following exercises (and more if you have time):
  - Section 9: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
  - Section 10: 10.1, 10.2 (really important), 10.3, (10.6, 10.7, 10.8)
  - Section 11: 11.1, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, (11.8, 11.9, 11.10)

  Try to find short, abstract proofs using the results that are already available to you.

* Write on Zulip if you have trouble with anything.
  The teachers are available to meet in person (use Zulip to figure out a good time).

Meeting: **November 17, 15:15–17:00** in **EF**
